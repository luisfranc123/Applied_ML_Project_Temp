# Applied Machine Learning Project 

This project contains the main stages of a Machine Learning applied project. The current study aims to implement an ML-based approach to predict global average temperature increases due to distinct agro-industrial activities.  

This Template contains the following structure: 

* `src`: Implemented the project code in Python.
* `docs`: Folder containing the project documentation following a CRISP-DM methodology. 
* `scripts`: Folder containing the Python scripts to execute all the project stages. 
* `pyproject.toml`: Project definition.

  **Note:** During the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) stage, there were some graphs created that were stored in doc/Images_EDA, following the same name given within the EDA script.
